## Introduction
The library management system allows managing readers, librarians and managing book lending and returning operations

- Basically, you can see the list of books available in the library and the current readers and librarians.
- Update the status of books when they are borrowed and returned.
- Calculate the time to borrow/return books and set appropriate penalties for violations
